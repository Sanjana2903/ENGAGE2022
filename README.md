ATTENDANCE PROJECT WITH FACIAL RECOGNITION
This is a web application which uses face recognition to login and for the new users to register and mark their attendance which is stored in a .csv file.

HOW DOES MY PROJECT SOLVE A REAL TIME PROBLEM:
This is a simple application, which can be used in any organisation to mark their students/employees attendance on a daily basis with the help of face recognition.This gives the organisation flexibility to ensure ones attendance whether working in online or offline mode.This is easy to access and do not create any clumsiness in marking the attendance of the employee.

BACKEND:
Python
Pickle
Flask
FRONTEND:
Html,css,js

LIBRARIES USED:
- Python-face_recognition (which Iâ€™ve downloaded from git )
- Python pickle (for storing data)
- Flask (for developing web application using python)

HOW DOES THIS WORK:
- Download/Clone the repository to your local system
- Run your server.py in your system.
- That will open a web sever that guides you through your attendance system
BEFORE RUNNING:
Make sure that the flask module is installed.
Face_recognition library is installed properly.

TO USE THE APPLICATION:
First a page will be opened asking to ligin/register

then for the one new to this website if we click on register it shows
< img src="/readme_imgs/registration_page.jpeg"/>
then it registers by capturing face
to login ,when clicked on login it directs to login page where you need to enter credentials and it captures face matching with registered face
< img src="/readme_imgs/login_page.jpeg"/>
then successfully logged in page is opened showing that attendance is marked.
when we check Attendance.csv file,we will be seeing that attendance is marked...!!
